=Hello World in CBL=

By special request, here is a quick start to the CBL command line interface (cbli.exe). 
You can download the CBL Interpreter from the downloads page in a zip package.

==The Code==

Here is how you write the famous "Hello World" program in CBL (save it as "sample.captcha"):

<code>
* Hello World in CBL
Say, "Hello World!"</code>

Which, when run (see below), produces this output:

<code>
Hello World!</code>

==Running the Code from the Command Line==

To run the above code file (assuming you saved it as "sample.captcha"), type this from the command line in the 
folder that contains the cbli.exe interpreter (wherever you extracted the CBL Command Line tool to):

<code>
>cbli -s sample.captcha</code>

This will run the script and produce output (if the Mode isn't set to display nothing).

General usage:

<code>
cbli.exe [-s script.captcha]</code>
